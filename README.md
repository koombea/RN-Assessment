# Live Coding Assesment React Native

The developer will be asked to develop a mobile application using the latest native programming language to develop an application using the documentation provided herein.

### Setup
- Install the axios library
- Install a navigation library

### Network
- Request a list of users from [this endpoint.](https://jserver-api.herokuapp.com/users)
- Create a list view with the list of users (like a chat). See example [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VZXdaR0hZorhaSvBr7jmDVjEU_xYOg07/view?usp=sharing)
- When clicked open the profile of the [user Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/wv7JNpjqKUUvQy4iz0OtmF/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1&t=OB1rwMGLiiPQv97k-1)
- Show the profile image of the user
- Show a view with the contact info to the side of the profile picture
- Store the data so it will load on the next reload of the app.


### Logic
- Add a ♥️ button to mark contacts as favorites
- When the favorites button is clicked the item is added to the favorites list.
- Create a new screen that will display the favorites list
- Show an alert if an error occurs
- Go back to the contact list when alert is dismissed
Advanced:
- Add animation to the favorites button
- Save the data in a local database
